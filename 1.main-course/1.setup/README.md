Want to install a basic package with an IDE, google chrome, update and stuff ?

Download this [file](resources/preparePC.sh) and place it on your desktop.

./preparePC.sh 
`````

Look them up, during this education it's important to actively look up things, whenever 
you're not sure you understand something, then look it up!

The best programmers are the people who always intrigue themselves by learning more than a project requires them to.
Follow this simple rule and you will understand a whole lot more coming out of this education than those who don't.
