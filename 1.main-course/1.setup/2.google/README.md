## Goals

After this chapter, you should have acquired the following technical competencies/skills:

**Practical**

- [ ] Able to use Google
- [ ] Help others through Googling



## General tips

**Search in English**  
English is the language of the internet (and the world). As such, the chance of finding what you are looking for is much higher when you search in English as opposed to searching in Dutch. This is especially true for anything technology related!

**Keep it simple**  
Google is smart (as is evident by its compulsive need to correct our spelling). More often than not, Google understands what you are asking. So don't use full sentences but rather stick to **keywords**.

**Use professional language**  
As the title says, use professional language. It's as simple as that!



## In-depth tips

The tips mentioned above are fairly generic, but nonetheless fundamental! Here are some of the *niche* features that Google offers:

**Search for an exact phrase**  
You can `"search for an exact phrase"` by using quotes.

**Exclude a word from your search**  
You can `-exclude` a specific word from your search by using a hyphen.

**Make a quick calculation**  
You can make a quick calculation in Google by entering your equation in the Google search bar.

**And so on...**  
Of course there's still much more that you can do with Google, but we'll leave that up to you to figure out!



## Help eachother
If you notice that one of your colleagues is having difficulties, help them out! The best way to do this is not to spoil the answer to their problem, but instead Google for a solution **together**.

***Note:** If you notice that someone is having a bit of a lazy day and is asking for answers rather than help, feel free to give them a passive-aggressive push in the right direction with [this tool](https://lmgtfy.com/)!*
