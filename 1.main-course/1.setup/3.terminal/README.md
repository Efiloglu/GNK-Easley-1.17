## Instructions
Did you know you can do a lot of awesome stuff with the terminal ? 
For example, all Ubuntu users, type: `telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl`, press enter, sit back and
enjoy the show!

Let's look at some of the things we can use the terminal for ***(in Ubuntu or any other Ubuntu based OS'es)***

## Exercises
These exercises are meant to be done alone, think about what you do, how you do it and what you can learn from 
completing the individual challenges.
A quiz will be done afterwards.

Maze / Investigatory Mansion with hidden folders and a bash script to run commands to examine (folders) objects etc etc
Find the key and the scrap of paper, to find the hidden passageway with the puzzle they solved, 
open it with they key to find the hidden phrase that will unlock their coding powers

### Exercise 1: 
1. Find out how to update your PC
1. Find out how to **upgrade** your PC
1. **Wow, what?! What does upgrade mean??** Look up the difference between the two...
  

## Goals

After this chapter, you should have acquired the following technical competencies:

**Practical**
- [ ] Able to open the terminal
- [ ] Able to show your current directory within the terminal
- [ ] Able to change your directory within the terminal
- [ ] Able to show the content of your current directory
- [ ] Able to make & delete a folder through the terminal
- [ ] Able to make & delete a file through the terminal
- [ ] Able to change filenames & foldernames through the terminal



## Exercise 1: Cheatsheet

Look up or make a cheatsheet with terminal commands. Compare this with the other people at your table. Shortly discuss the pro's and cons of the different cheatsheets, and then pick one you would like to use.



## Exercise 2: A step by step introduction

Before we start, lets download a random unicorn image and save it on your Desktop with the name `random-unicorn`. Next, lets open the terminal with the shortcut `CTRL` + `ALT` + `T`.

**The steps that follow, should only be executed through the terminal!**

* Navigate to the folder `Desktop` with the *Change Directory* command.
* Check to see if you are in the desktop folder by printing the *Present Working Directory*.
* Create a file: `text.txt` (in your desktop folder).
* Open the file in a texteditor and write a line of text (the first sentence that comes to mind). Then, save the file.
* Make a folder called [`Octocat`](https://www.google.com/search?biw=812&bih=919&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=1zvmXJ7UEJGYkwWQ3baYBw&q=octocat&oq=octocat&gs_l=img.12...0.0..64674...0.0..0.0.0.......1......gws-wiz-img.EpW9s-YxPyU).
* Navigate into your new 'Octocat' folder.
* Once in your new directory, create a file: `yolo.md`.
* Open the file and enter your name in it. Then, save the file and close it.
* Make a second file in the same directory, called `readme.md`.
* In a little paragraph, write a text concerning some of the projects you want to achieve during your training at BeCode. (or, ... you know... a dirty joke)
* Make a third file in 'Octocat' , named after your first and last name with the `.md` extension. In that file, write a little text explaining why you want to be a Web Developer.
* Remove the file `text.txt`.
* List the contents of the `Octocat` directory.
* Create the folder `Skills` and create a file `successful.md` in which you write down your computer skills. This can be a list, either with the languages you know or the languages you want to know.
* Create the folder `becode_projects` in which you can store all your future BeCode files.
