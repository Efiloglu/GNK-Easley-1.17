## Exercise / Setup
Create `index.php` and copy the content from [`index.html`](./resources/index.html).<br/>
Download [`styles.css`](./resources/styles.css) along with it and open the index file on your server.

Once opened, read and try to understand what the javascript code does. Then try to write the same functionality in `PHP`.<br/>
Don't try to copy line by line and convert the syntax, this kind of conversion requires some out of the box thinking ! ;)


### Rules of the game
* **No Javascript is allowed on the page anymore**
* Use `PHP` to write the same functionality as what the javascript had
* Your `PHP` should at least have the following code:
    * a loop
    * a condition
    * variables
    * a function
    * a random number generator
* Your page has to look exactly the same as the initial JS build.
* The different components have to be procedurally generated in the same way
* You can change the global variables (in the `head`) their values as you please


## Goals
- [ ] Applying your knowledge of Javascript.
- [ ] Applying your techskills to recognize similarities and differences.
- [ ] Learning to code PHP (base syntax understanding).
- [ ] Understanding the general workflow when interacting with HTML from PHP.
- [ ] Learning where to look when starting on a completely new topic.
