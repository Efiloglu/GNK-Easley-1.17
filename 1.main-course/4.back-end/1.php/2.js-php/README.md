## Exercise / Setup
Download [`index.html`](./resources/index.html) and [`styles.css`](./resources/styles.css), 
create `index.php` and copy index.html's content into it, then open that in your browser / on your server.
Once opened, read and try to understand what the javascript code does, then write the same functionality in `PHP`.
Don't try to copy line by line and convert the syntax, this kind of conversion requires some out of the box thinking ! ;)


### Rules of the game
* **No Javascript is allowed on the page anymore**
* Use `PHP` to write the same functionality as what the javascript had
* Your `PHP` should at least have the following code:
    * a loop
    * a condition
    * variables
    * a function
    * a random number generator
* Your page has to look exactly the same as the initial JS build.
* The different components have to be procedurally generated in the same way
* You can change the global variables (in the `head`) their values as you please


## Goals
- [ ] Applying your knowledge of Javascript.
- [ ] Applying your techskills to recognize similarities and differences.
- [ ] Learning to code PHP (base syntax understanding).
- [ ] Understanding the general workflow when interacting with HTML from PHP.
- [ ] Learning where to look when starting on a completely new topic.
