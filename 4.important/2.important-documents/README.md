# Important documents

Here, you can find some important documents that you might need during your training at BeCode!



## Absence forms

### Exceptional absences

This document is meant for an absence that is truly exceptional. As such, it's not meant for absences that can be justified with an official document, and it most definitely does not serve as a replacement for a doctor's note!

### External events

This document is meant for absences that are the result of you attending an external event that is relevant to your education here! (think: a coding workshop or a presentation about new technologies...)
